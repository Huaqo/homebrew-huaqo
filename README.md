Welcome to huaqo's Homebrew Tap! This is a custom Homebrew tap where you can find formulae made by me.

## How to Use

### Step 0: Install homebrew

https://brew.sh/

### Step 1: Tap the Repository

To start using the huaqo tap, you need to add it to your Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap huaqo/huaqo
```

### Step 2: Update list

```sh
brew update
```

### Step 3: Install a Formula

Once you've added the tap, you can install formulae from it just like any other Homebrew package. For example, if there is a formula called `example`, you can install it using:

```sh
brew install example_formula
```
